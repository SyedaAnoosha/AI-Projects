Write me a fully complete web app as a single HTML file. The app should contain a simple side-scrolling game where I use WASD to move around. When moving around the world, occasionally the character/sprite will encounter words. When a word is encountered, the player must correctly type the word as fast as possible.The faster the word is successfully typed, the more point the player gets. We should have a counter in the top-right to keep track of points. Words should be random and highly variable to keep the game interesting.
You should make the website very aesthetic and use Tailwind.

Hey Hal, I’m thinking about taking a trip to Europe next month. Any suggestions on where I should go?
```

### Assistant (Prefill)

```text
Oh, Europe? How original! It’s not like millions of tourists flock there every year. But since you asked, I’d recommend visiting the hidden gems like Paris, Rome, or Barcelona. They’re totally off the beaten path and not at all crowded with selfie-stick-wielding tourists. 📸🗼
If you’re feeling adventurous, you could always try visiting a place that isn’t plastered all over Instagram, like Liechtenstein or Andorra. I hear they have a combined population of 37 people, so you’ll have plenty of space to yourself. 🏔️🌄
But in all seriousness, Europe has a lot to offer. What kind of experience are you looking for? History, culture, food, or just a chance to take pictures of yourself pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Let me know, and I’ll try to provide some more helpful (and less sarcastic) suggestions. 😉🌍

Meeting notes:
Date: Verona, Italy - Late 16th century
Attendees:
- Lord Capulet (Head of the Capulet family)
- Lord Montague (Head of the Montague family)
- Prince Escalus (Ruler of Verona)
- Friar Laurence (Religious advisor)
Agenda:
1. Address the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families
2. Discuss the secret marriage of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet
3. Develop a plan to bring peace to Verona
4. Address the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet
Discussion:
- Prince Escalus opened the meeting by expressing his grave concern over the long-standing feud between the Capulet and Montague families. He admonished both Lord Capulet and Lord Montague for the recent violent clashes that have disturbed the peace in Verona’s streets. The Prince warned that further violence would result in severe consequences, including heavy fines and potential exile for the perpetrators.
- Friar Laurence then broached the topic of the between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, which had taken place under his guidance. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague evidently had not known about it, and reacted with anger and disbelief. However, Friar Laurence urged them to consider the profound and tragic love shared by their children and the potential for this love to heal the rift between the families going forward.
- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the Capulet and Montague families. He demanded that both sides lay down their arms and cease all hostile actions against one another. The Prince declared that any violation of the truce would result in severe punishments, including the possibility of exile or even execution. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, recognizing the wisdom in the Prince’s words and the necessity of peace for the well-being of their families and the city, grudgingly agreed to the terms of the truce.
- The meeting took a somber turn as the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were addressed. Friar Laurence recounted the unfortunate series of events that led to the young lovers taking their own lives, emphasizing the devastating impact of the families’ hatred on their innocent children. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, overcome with grief and remorse, acknowledged that their blind hatred had ultimately caused the loss of their beloved children.
- Prince Escalus called upon the families to learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and to embrace forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet’s memory. He urged them to work together to create a lasting peace in Verona, setting aside their long-standing animosity. Friar Laurence offered his support in mediating any future disputes and providing spiritual guidance to help the families heal and move forward.
- As the meeting drew to a close, Lord Capulet and Lord Montague pledged to put an end to their feud and work towards reconciliation. Prince Escalus reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that the truce would be upheld, promising swift justice for any who dared to break it.
- The attendees agreed to meet regularly to discuss the progress of their reconciliation efforts and to address any challenges that may arise.

I’ve been using your email marketing platform for a few weeks, and I must say, the core features like campaign creation, email templates, and contact management are fantastic. The drag-and-drop editor makes it easy to design professional-looking emails, and the segmentation options help me target the right audience. However, I’ve had some issues with the mobile responsiveness of the emails. Some of my subscribers have reported that the layouts look broken on their smartphones, which is concerning. I’d love to see improvements in this area. Also, I noticed that the platform is missing some key integrations with popular CRM tools, which would be incredibly helpful for managing our leads and customers. On a positive note, the customer support team has been responsive and helpful whenever I’ve reached out with questions. Overall, it’s a great tool, but there’s definitely room for improvement in terms of mobile compatibility and third-party integrations.
