# Micro-Coach — Micro decision assistant

Micro-Coach is a lightweight chatbot designed to help users make small everyday decisions quickly. It's a teaching/demo project that shows how to wire a Streamlit frontend to a Flask backend which calls a Groq LLM for conversational guidance.

## Summary

- Purpose: Offer short, practical, non-judgmental suggestions for small decisions (time management, social replies, quick habit nudges).
- Scope: Demo — not a replacement for professional advice (no medical/legal/financial decisions).
- Tech: Flask backend (API), Streamlit frontend (UI), Groq LLM for generation.
